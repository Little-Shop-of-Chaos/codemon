- **🔴 Go vs Rust:** 71% win rate (Go heavily favored)
- **🔵 Python vs C#:** 21% win rate (C# heavily favored)
- **🔵 Go vs C#:** 29% win rate (C# heavily favored)

## 💡 Balance Recommendations

### Immediate Nerfs Needed
1. **OCaml - Pattern Matching:** Reduce power from 80 to 60
2. **C# - LINQ Query:** Reduce power from 70 to 50
3. **JavaScript - Asynchronous Promise:** Reduce power from 60 to 45
4. **Go - Goroutine Swarm:** Reduce power from 45 to 35

### Immediate Buffs Needed
1. **JavaScript - Framework Flux:** Increase power from 10 to 30
2. **OCaml - Type Inference:** Increase power from 10 to 25
3. **Rust - Borrow Checker:** Increase power from 10 to 25

### Language-Specific Adjustments
- **C#:** Consider reducing base stats or ability cooldowns
- **Rust:** Consider increasing base stats or ability power
- **JavaScript:** Consider increasing base stats or ability power

## 📈 Overall Balance Score: 44.4%

**Status:** 🔴 Significant balance issues detected

The simulation reveals that while some languages and abilities are well-balanced, there are clear overpowered and underpowered elements that need adjustment for fair gameplay.

## 🎮 Simulation Methodology

### Battle Mechanics
- **Damage Formula:** `(Ability_Power * (Attacker_Attack / Defender_Defense)) * Random_Factor`
- **Random Factor:** 0.85 to 1.0
- **Accuracy:** Based on ability accuracy percentage
- **Turn Order:** Determined by speed stat
- **Battle Length:** Maximum 50 turns

### Ability Selection
- **50-50 Split:** Each language randomly chooses between ability 1 and ability 2
- **No Cooldowns:** Abilities can be used every turn
- **No Status Effects:** Simplified simulation without complex status mechanics

### Matchup Coverage
- **Total Matchups:** 15 unique language pairs
- **Battles per Matchup:** 100
- **Total Battles:** 1,500
